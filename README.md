This is a dummy, what a real program can be!
Walnut is a simple application framework built with Dear ImGui and designed to be used with Vulkan - basically this means you can seemlessly blend real-time Vulkan rendering.

## Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) (preferably a recent version)

### 3rd party libaries
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (included for convenience)
